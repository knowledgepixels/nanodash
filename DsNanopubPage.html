<h4><em>Reviewer Instruction</em></h4>
<p>To assess this nanopublication, check its content below, <strong>most importantly the blue assertion part</strong>, and also consider the description of the used template and any reactions it has received.</p>
<p>
<strong>This is experimental and optional.</strong>
We hope you can help us assess this nanopublication and we can assist you with that (see at the bottom of this page), but it is also perfectly fine to skip this step if you do not feel up to it.

<h3>Nanopublication</h3>

<p>
A nanopublication contains as main content a statement in the <strong>assertion part (shown in blue)</strong> encoded in a way that computers can understand.
It is expressed as one or more <strong>subject-relation-object structures</strong>, each shown on a separate line,
where the identifier of the subject (left) is connected to the identifier of the object (right) via the identifier of the relation type (middle).
