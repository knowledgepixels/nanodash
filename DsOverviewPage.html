<h2>Nanopublishing in Data Science</h2>

<a href="https://datasciencehub.net/"><img alt="Data Science logo" wicket:id="logo" style="width: 300px"></a>

<p>
The Data Science journal recommends that papers come with their main (and other) findings represented in a machine-understandable way as nanopublications.
</p>

<p>
To do so, first create and publish your nanopublications by following the links and instructions below, and then link them from your <a href="https://datasciencehub.net/node/add/submit-paper">new submission</a> or existing manuscript at the journal website.
</p>


<h3>Supported Types of Nanopublications</h3>

<p>
You can choose from the following types of nanopublications to express your claims:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=superpattern">General Super-Pattern Statements:</a>
Such statements are advanced and logically precise scientific statements, such as <em>"whenever a person has a headache then this is mostly caused by a condition of dehydration of that person"</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: advanced</strong>
</li>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=linkflowsrel">Simple Causal/Spatio-Temporal/Comparative Relations between Instances:</a>
Such statements state a general causal (e.g. <em>caused</em>), spatio-temporal (e.g. <em>is included in</em>), or comparative (e.g. <em>is larger than</em>) relation between two individuals,
for example that the invention of the telephone was necessary for the Internet. Note that subject and object (like the invention of the telephone and the Internet) need to be individual instances, not classes of things.
<strong>Difficulty: medium</strong>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You can also define new classes and instances (these are typically used as auxiliary statements, and not as main claims of a manuscript):
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=classdef">Class Definitions:</a>
Such statements define a new class, such as <em>operant research</em> as a subclass of <em>research</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=inddef">Definition of Individual:</a>
Such statements define a new individual as an instance of a class, for example the <em>Leiden Declaration on FAIR Digital Objects</em> as an instance of the class <em>manifesto</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

</ul>
