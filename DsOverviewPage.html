<h2>Nanopublishing in Data Science</h2>

<a href="https://datasciencehub.net/"><img alt="Data Science logo" wicket:id="logo" style="width: 300px"></a>

<p>
The Data Science journal recommends that papers come with their findings represented in a machine-understandable way as <a href="https://nanopub.net/" target="_blank">nanopublications</a>.
</p>

<div class="instruction">
<h4><em>Author Instruction</em></h4>
<p>
Explore the pages for the different types of nanopublications below and try to express your findings and related statements.
Once you have published your own candidate nanopublications, these pages will show you how they can be
linked from your new submission or existing manuscript at the <a href="https://datasciencehub.net/" target="_blank">journal website</a>.

<h3>Choose Nanopublication Types</h3>

<p>
These types work for simpler kinds of scientific statements:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=linkflowsrel">Simple Scientific Relations between Individuals</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>the invention of the telephone was necessary for the Internet</em>).
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=crel">Simple Scientific Relations based on Classes</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>instances of smoking tend to cause instances of lung cancer</em>).
</li>

</ul>

<p>
If your statement is more complex, one of these types might work:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=superpattern">Fully-formal Advanced Statements (Super-Pattern)</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>whenever a person has a headache then this is mostly caused by a dehydration of that person</em>).
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=aida">Semi-formal Statements Based on English Sentences (AIDA)</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>"Teenagers reply on average faster to emails than adults." is about: teenager, email, adult</em>)
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Using the types above, you might see that you need to define a new class or individual first:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=classdef">Class Definitions</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>operant research</em> as a subclass of <em>research</em>).
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector/ios/ds/type?type=inddef">Definitions of Individuals</a></strong>
(e.g. <em>Pluto</em> as an instance of the class <em>dwarf planet</em>).
</li>

</ul>
