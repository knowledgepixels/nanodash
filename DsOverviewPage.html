<h2>Nanopublishing in Data Science</h2>

<a href="https://datasciencehub.net/"><img alt="Data Science logo" wicket:id="logo" style="width: 300px"></a>

<p>
The Data Science journal recommends that papers come with their main (and other) findings represented in a machine-understandable way as <a href="https://nanopub.net/" target="_blank">nanopublications</a>.
</p>

<p>
To do so, first create and publish your nanopublications by following the links and instructions below, and then link them from your <a href="https://datasciencehub.net/node/add/submit-paper">new submission</a> or existing manuscript at the journal website.
</p>


<h3>Supported Types of Nanopublications</h3>

<p>
Choose from the following nanopublication types to express your claims:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=linkflowsrel">Simple Scientific Relations between Instances:</a>
Such statements state a general causal (e.g. <em>A caused B</em>), spatio-temporal (e.g. <em>A is included in B</em>), or comparative (e.g. <em>A is larger than B</em>) relation between two individuals,
for example that the invention of the telephone was necessary for the Internet. Note that subject and object (like the invention of the telephone and the Internet) need to be individual instances, not classes of things.
<strong>Difficulty: medium</strong>
</li>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=crel">Simple Scientific Relations based on Classes:</a>
As above, such statements state a general causal/spatio-temporal/comparative relation, but based on classes rather than directly specifying the individuals.
For example, it can state that instances of the class <em>smoking</em> tend to have the relation of <em>causing</em> to instances of the class <em>lung cancer</em>.
Such statements are less precise than the super-pattern statements below, as the aspect of <em>"tending to"</em> is underspecified.
<strong>Difficulty: medium</strong>
</li>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=superpattern">General Super-Pattern Statements:</a>
Such statements are advanced and logically precise scientific statements, such as <em>"whenever a person has a headache then this is mostly (&gt;50%) caused by a condition of dehydration of that person"</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: advanced</strong>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You can also define new classes and instances, if applicable:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=classdef">Class Definitions:</a>
Such statements define a new class, such as <em>operant research</em> as a subclass of <em>research</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

<li>
<a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=inddef">Definition of Individual:</a>
Such statements define a new individual as an instance of a class, for example the <em>Leiden Declaration on FAIR Digital Objects</em> as an instance of the class <em>manifesto</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

</ul>
