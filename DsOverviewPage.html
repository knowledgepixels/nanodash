<h2>Nanopublishing in Data Science</h2>

<a href="https://datasciencehub.net/"><img alt="Data Science logo" wicket:id="logo" style="width: 300px"></a>

<p>
The Data Science journal recommends that papers come with their findings represented in a machine-understandable way as <a href="https://nanopub.net/" target="_blank">nanopublications</a>.
</p>

<p>
This site guides you to create and publish your nanopublications, which you can then link from your new submission or existing manuscript at the <a href="https://datasciencehub.net/" target="_blank">journal website</a>.
</p>


<h3>Choose Nanopublication Types</h3>

<p>
These nanopublication types are supported by the journal to express your scientific claims:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=linkflowsrel">Simple Scientific Relations between Instances</a></strong>
establish a general causal (e.g. <em>A caused B</em>), spatio-temporal (e.g. <em>A is included in B</em>), or comparative (e.g. <em>A is larger than B</em>) relation between two individuals (not classes),
for example that the invention of the telephone was necessary for the Internet.
<strong>Difficulty: medium</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=crel">Simple Scientific Relations based on Classes</a></strong>
state a general causal/spatio-temporal/comparative relation as above, but based on classes rather than individuals.
For example, we can state that instances of the class <em>smoking</em> tend to have the relation of <em>causing</em> to instances of the class <em>lung cancer</em>.
Such statements are less precise than the super-pattern statements below, as the aspect of <em>"tending to"</em> is underspecified.
<strong>Difficulty: medium</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=superpattern">General Super-Pattern Statements</a></strong>
are advanced and logically precise scientific statements, such as <em>"whenever a person has a headache then this is mostly (&gt;50%) caused by a condition of dehydration of that person"</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: advanced</strong>
</li>

<li>
<em>Coming soon:</em>
<strong>AIDA Statements</strong>
use English sentences to make statements formally linkable without having to formally specify the statements themselves.
If the above types do not seem feasible for you, AIDA statements might be a good option.
<strong>Difficulty: low to medium</strong>
</li>

<li>
<em>Coming soon:</em>
<strong>Life Science Statements from Free Text</strong> (at external tool Knowledge Collaboratory)
are automatically suggested formal statements based on free text you write down or paste in. They only work on Life Science topics at the moment.
<strong>Difficulty: low to medium</strong>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
These types allow you to introduce and describe your new approach, software, or dataset:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<em>Coming soon:</em>
<strong>Approach Introductions</strong>
describe a new scientific approach.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

<li>
<em>Coming soon:</em>
<strong>Software Introductions</strong>
describe a new piece of software of scientific relevance.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

<li>
<em>Coming soon:</em>
<strong>Dataset Introductions</strong>
describe a new scientific dataset.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You can also define new classes and instances:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=classdef">Class Definitions</a></strong>
declare a new class, such as <em>operant research</em> as a subclass of <em>research</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="/connector-ios-ds-type?type=inddef">Definitions of Individuals</a></strong>
declare a new individual as an instance of a class, for example <em>Pluto</em> as an instance of the class <em>dwarf planet</em>.
<strong>Difficulty: low</strong>
</li>

</ul>
