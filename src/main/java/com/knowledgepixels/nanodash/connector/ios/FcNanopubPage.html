<div class="instruction" wicket:id="reviewer-instruction">
<h4><em>Reviewer Instruction</em></h4>
<p>
To assess this nanopublication, check its content below, <strong>most importantly the blue assertion part</strong>,
and also consider the description of the used template and any reactions it has received.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This is experimental and optional.</strong>
We hope you can help us assess this nanopublication and we can assist you with that (see at the bottom of this page), but it is also perfectly fine to skip this step if you do not feel up to it
(which you can indicate in the review form).
</p>
<p>
Hover over the terms in the blue assertion part to see tooltips explaining what these terms mean.
</p>
<p>
You are also encouraged to take any reactions listed below into account for your review.
You may also publish reactions yourself below, but this is not required.
</p>
<p>
In the end, provide your assessment via the review form at <code>fairconnect.pro</code>.

<h3>Nanopublication
<span class="expltooltip">&#9432;<span class="expltooltiptext">
A nanopublication contains as main content a statement in the <strong>assertion part (shown in blue)</strong> encoded in a way that computers can understand.
It is expressed as one or more <strong>subject-relation-object structures</strong>, each shown on a separate line,
where the identifier of the subject (left) is connected to the identifier of the object (right) via the identifier of the relation type (middle).
