nanobench TODOs
===============

- More links to improve navigation
- Improving calls to the network API; make more reliable
- Make templating (more or less) future-proof
- Regular expression restrictions for template values?
- ORCID linking instructions
- Make more templates:
  - commenting on things (including nanopubs)
  - retracting nanopubs
  - foaf:knows
  - approves/confirms/acknowledges
  - arbitrary triple
- More Ajax components

Later:

- Check for whether user is using latest version of nanobench
- Support long text comments in templates
- Check whether ORCID links to same public key, not necessarily to the same intro nanopub
