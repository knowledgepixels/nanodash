===============

Highest priority:

- Make more templates:
  - foaf:knows
  - defining new individual/class/relation

Lower priority:

- More Ajax components
- Define ntemplate vocabulary
- Make more templates:
  - approves/confirms/acknowledges

Later:

- Check for whether user is using latest version of nanobench
- Support long text comments in templates
- Check whether ORCID links to same public key, not necessarily to the same intro nanopub
- Preview before publication
- Use templates to display nanopublications that were generated from them in a nicer way
- Make nanopublication page (showing nanopub content together with back-links, comments, etc.)
